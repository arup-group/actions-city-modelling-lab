# Actions
Reusable GitHub Action workflows.

## Example usage

You can find more detail on reusable workflows in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)

If you want to add a CI run for your project `my-great-project` whenever a push is made to the repository:

``` yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
  branches:
    - "**"

jobs:
  test:
    uses: fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/python-install-lint-test.yml@main
    with:
      os: ubuntu-latest
      py3version: "11"
      notebook_kernel: "my-great-project"
      lint: true
```

To do the same across a matrix of operating systems and python versions, maybe when a pull request is opened / ready for review:

``` yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types:
      - opened
      - ready_for_review
      - review_requested

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        py3version: ["9", "10", "11"]
    uses: arup-fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/python-install-lint-test.yml@main
    with:
      os: ${{ matrix.os }}
      py3version: ${{ matrix.py3version }}
      notebook_kernel: "my-great-project"
      # ignore coverage and linting, those come in the deep-dive below.
      lint: false
      pytest_args: '--no-cov'
      upload_to_codecov: false

  test-deep-dive:  # Run again on ubuntu-latest py3.11 with linting and coverage reporting.
    uses: fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/python-install-lint-test.yml@main
    with:
      os: ubuntu-latest
      py3version: "11"
      notebook_kernel: "my-great-project"
      lint: true
      pytest_args: 'tests/ mkdocs_plugins/'  # ignore example notebooks.
      upload_to_codecov: true
```

You can also chain reusable workflows:

``` yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "**"

jobs:
  test:
    uses: fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/python-install-lint-test.yml@main
    with:
      os: ubuntu-latest
      py3version: "11"
      notebook_kernel: "my-great-project"
      lint: true
  aws-upload:
    needs: test
    if: needs.test.result == 'success'
    uses: fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/aws-upload.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
  slack-notify-ci:
    needs: test
    uses: fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/slack-notify.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      result: needs.test.result
      channel: my-great-project-feed
      message: "Commit CI action"
  slack-notify-aws:
    needs: aws-upload
    uses: fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/slack-notify.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      result: needs.aws-upload.result
      channel: my-great-project-feed
      message: "AWS upload action"
```

!!! note

  You can _only_ use `secrets: inherit` if you are hosting your repository in the `fredshone` organisation.
  If you have the repo under your own username, you will need to explicitly pass the necessary secrets, e.g.:

  ``` yaml
  secrets:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
  ```

## Available workflows

### Upload package to AWS

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/aws-upload.yml`

_description_: Upload the current state of the repository as a zipped file to an AWS S3 bucket.
This may then be picked up by AWS CodeBuild to e.g. build a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the zip.

_Inputs_: None

_Required secrets_: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_S3_CODE_BUCKET`

### Build a conda package

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/conda-build.yml`

_description_: Build a conda package and store it as an artefact in your gitHub repository.
This could be used in a release pull request, ready to upload the build to Anaconda in a tagged release of your package.

_Inputs_:
 - package_name: Name of your package, as defined in your `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file (if your repo is a Python project).

_Required secrets_: `ANACONDA_TOKEN` (required to verify that later upload will not fail)

### Upload a conda package

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/conda-upload.yml`

_description_: Upload a built conda package stored as an artefact in your gitHub repository (see [](#build-a-conda-package)).
This could be used when you publish a new release of your package on gitHub.

_Inputs_:
 - package_name: Name of your package, as defined in your `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file (if your repo is a Python project).

_Required secrets_: `ANACONDA_TOKEN`

### Deploy documentation

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`

_description_: Deploy [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation using [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) to your repository's `gh-pages` branch.

_Inputs_:
 - package_name: Name of your package, as defined in your `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file (if your repo is a Python project).
 - development_version_name (optional, default="develop"): The name of the docs version which follows the project's `main` branch builds, i.e., not linked to a versioned release.
 - deploy_type: What type of doc deployment to undertake, option of: ["test", "update_latest", "update_stable"]
   `test` will not deploy any documentation, only dry-run the doc build pipeline to check there are no errors.
   `update_latest` will build the docs and use it to update the `develop` version of your `gh-pages` branch, assuming the alias `latest` links to the named version `develop`.
   `update_stable` will build the docs and use it to add a new version of your docs on `gh-pages` branch and will update the alias `stable` to point at this version.
 - notebook_kernel: If jupyter notebooks are included in the docs, specify the kernel name they expect, e.g. the package name.

_Required secrets_: None

### Run tests on python package

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/python-install-lint-test.yml`

_description_: Run your tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org), (optionally) check your code quality with [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/), and (optionally) upload your test coverage report to [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/).

_Inputs_:
 - os: Operating system to run this workflow on. Should match a valid Github runner name.
 - py3version: Minor version of Python version 3 to run the test on (e.g. `11` for python v3.11).
 -  mamba_env_name (optional, default={{inputs.os}}-3{{inputs.py3version}}): Name of the Mamba environment. If it matches a name of a cached environment in the caller repository, that cache will be used.
 - additional_mamba_args (optional, default=""): Any additional arguments to pass to micromamba when creating the python environment.
 - cache_mamba_env (optional, default=true): If true, cache the mamba environment for speedier CI. Caches use the env name + a hash of the passed arguments. NOTE: this can lead to large amounts of cache space being used (600MB per env)
 - notebook_kernel (optional, default=""): If jupyter notebooks are tested, specify the kernel name they expect, e.g. the package name
 - lint (optional, default=true): If true, check code quality with the Ruff linter.
 - pytest_args (optional, default=""): Additional arguments to pass to pytest.
 - upload_to_codecov (optional, default=false): If true, upload coverage report to codecov. This assumes your repository is public as it does not expect an API key.

_Required secrets_: None

### Run memory profiling tests on python package

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/python-memory-profile.yml`

_description_: Run a subset of your tests marked as "high_mem" using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) and [memray](https://bloomberg.github.io/memray/).

_Inputs_:
 - py3version: Minor version of Python version 3 to run the test on (e.g. `11` for python v3.11).
 - additional_mamba_args (optional, default=""): Any additional arguments to pass to micromamba when creating the python environment.
 - upload_flamegraph (optional, default=False): If True, upload the memory profiling flamegraph as an action artefact, stored for 90 days.

_Required secrets_: None

### Notify about action success / failure on a slack channel

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/slack-notify.yml`

_description_: Have a bot notify you of build success or failure on a Slack feed of your choice.

_Inputs_:
 - result: Result of running the caller workflow (e.g., 'success', 'failure', 'skipped').
 - channel: Slack channel to which the bot notification is sent.
 - message: Sub-string to include in the message, e.g. the name of the "caller" workflow.

_Required secrets_: `SLACK_WEBHOOK`

### Check if project is up-to-date with parent template

_URL_: `fredshone/actions/.github/workflows/template-check.yml`

_description_: If your project was generated using a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template, check whether there are changes to the template that could be pulled into the project.
